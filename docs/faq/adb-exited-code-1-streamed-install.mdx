# Error: ADB exited with exit code 1 Performing Streamed Install

If you're running the Android emulator on a low-memory machine, you may get an `INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE` error as explained here:

- [Error: ADB exited with exit code 1 Performing Streamed Install | StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57000915/error-adb-exited-with-exit-code-1-performing-streamed-install)

As explained in the link above, this can be solved by **wiping the emulator data**.

Then you can run these commands and try again:

```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Notes about creating the Android emulator

- You can try to install devices such as `Pixel_3a_XL_API_32`, `Pixel_4a_API_32`, `Pixel_5_API_32` as they may use less memory.
